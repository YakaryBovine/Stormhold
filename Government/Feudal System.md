The King ostensibly owns all of the land in Sundren, but grants large portions of it to his Lords in exchange for their military service and fealty. Those lords can in turn grant portions of their own land to their Knights or lesser Lords below them.

Knights are well-trained warriors, and are often granted land by their lords in exchange for military service and protection.

Serfs work the land and produce the food and goods that support the entire Sundren hierarchy. In return for working the land, they receive protection from their lords but have few rights and are bound to the land they worked on.

Mages are individuals capable of performing magic. The King funds the [[Stormwatch Academy]] through taxes received from the mobility, and in turn, the Academy trains fresh Mages and supplies their service to members of the nobility. Traditionally, the head of each family receives one Mage, with the wealthiest houses receiving the most powerful Mages. The throne is instead served by the Grand Magister, who is also the honorary head of Stormwatch Academy.
