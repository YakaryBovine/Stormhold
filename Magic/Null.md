Nulls individuals are those who have had their [[Animus]] destroyed, either through the [[Rite of Severing]], by having their [[Phylactery]] smashed, or by losing their Animus anchor after the [[Rite of Bonding]]. Nulls are incapable of magic, and have been robbed of their emotion and drive. They act entirely without initiative or intuition, usually following clear instructions given to them but interested in little else.
