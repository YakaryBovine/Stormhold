A Mage who has had their Animus removed via the [[Rite of Severing]], but whose Animus has not yet decayed and is wholly contained within a sealed vessel, can perform the Rite of Entanglement to bind their own severed Animus to their body. A successful Mage averts their otherwise inevitable fate of becoming Null, but the Animus remains within the vessel, which becomes their [[Phylactery]].
