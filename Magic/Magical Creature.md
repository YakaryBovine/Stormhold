Most creatures in the world are mundane, part of the natural ecosystem.
Some, however, are born with loose [[Animus]]es - much like Mages. These creatures possess extraordinary powers and unique forms. Due to their power, they tend to be extraordinarily dangerous predators, their existences posing an existential threat to nature and civilization alike.

Magical creatures derive some of their attributes from the mundane creatures that birthed them. Bulls, for instance, can produce minotaur, while particularly large lizards can produce dragons. Magical creatures themselves are infertile.

In the [[Kingdom of Venidar]], magical creatures are seen as both threats and great sport. The nobility hunt down the most dangerous creatures for glory and entertainment, leaving those of middling threat to hired swords and serfs. Some, instead, are bound by the [[Rite of Bonding]] to serve a particular King or lord.
