A Phylactery is a vessel containing the [[Animus]] of a [[Mage]] extracted via the [[Rite of Severing]]. Traditionally a Phylactery is a transparent glass orb encased in a thin golden lattice, though any vessel can be used as long as it keeps the Animus intact and contained. The Animus within appears as a murky-white viscous liquid.

Exposing the Animus within the Phylactery to the outside air causes it to congeal into a thick, dark-red paste. After seven minutes of continuous exposure or separation, the Animus dies, rendering the Mage it belongs to permanently [[Null]]. Possessing a Mage's Phylactery offers immense power over that Mage, as the simple act of destroying it instantly takes away their ability to cast magic - and their autonomy.
