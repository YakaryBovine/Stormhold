Ordinary humans are born with their [[Animus]] firmly embedded in their hearts, anchoring their inner lives to their mortal form. Mages, on the other hand, are born with loosely attached, overflowing Animuses.

Through extensive study, Mages can learn to harness their unique Animuses to perform magic: arts, spells, and rituals that influence the fabric of reality to produce wondrous or devastating effects. Magic is extraordinarily difficult, and nearly impossible for anyone to learn without dedicated education.

Mages' loose Animuses render them susceptible to a procedure known as the [[Rite of Severing]], which separates a Mage's Animus from their bodies and stores it in a [[Phylactery]].
